          Kickback software requires that you commit a small payment when you
          RSVP to reserve your spot. Event attendance is determined by the event
          organisers or an event admin.
        </p>

        <div>
          Following the event:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the event organisers will check you in you will receive
              notification via email or twitter (based on your registration).
              Typically you have limited time window or “cooling period”
              (default is one week but the duration may vary) to withdraw your
              funds from the event smart contract. After the cooling period has
              passed, you acknowledge that you are not interested in retrieving
              your funds and the smart contract owner has the right to clear the
              remaining funds according to the rule specified in the smart
              contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the event organiser did not check you in, you will lose any
              funds you committed. These funds will be divided among the event
              attendees or they can be applied in other ways (charitable
              contribution, sponsorship of future events etc)
            </li>
            <li>
              We are not liable for any losses resulting from for any disputes
              regarding your attendance status. Whether you are marked as
              attended or not is strictly at the event organizers' discretion.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          If you did not register a correct email or twitter address during
          signup process, we have no way to notify you when/whether you are able
          to withdraw funds. If this is the case, it is your responsibility to
          visit our website and confirm the status of the funds. In case the
          organizer decides to cancel the event, you will be able to withdraw
          funds, but will be again required to do so within the time window of
          the “cooling period” (default is one week but the duration may vary)
          In case the smart contract is exploited due to bugs or its account was
          compromised, you will not be compensated for your loss.
